See http://www.camminady.org/every-cyclist-of-the-tour-de-france-in-a-single-csv-file/ for a description.

The following problems are known:
1905 - 0
1906 - 0    
1907 - p
1908 - 0
1909 - p
1910 - p
1911 - p
1912 - p
Where 0 means that all times are zero and p means that the column for the timing actually contained the overall points and not the timings (this was an error on the LeTour.fr website).
